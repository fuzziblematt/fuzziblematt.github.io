        The unremarkable Erotics of Vicariousness - Milan Kundera*
    </h1>

        In order to access his unconscious, the surrealist Salvador Dali would have his wife wake him in the middle of the night in order that he might transcribe his dreams. The great painter would then draw on these notes to create some of the most magnificent and playful art of the twentieth century. I like to think that after the artist was finished with his note-taking, they would make passionate love.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was of Dali that Gabor thought, when he began taking on the night shifts with baby Elena, once she had been weaned. Four, perhaps five times a night, Gabor would rouse himself to the siren of her screams, clip the sling around his waist and lift his bawling babe out of her cot. He suspected he was doing something very wrong, methodologically speaking, and he resolved several times a night to consult the literature on the topic the next day. But after a few minutes Elena would be asleep again, and he would be awake, after a fashion. And so he would float silently over to the dresser, Elena still clipped in, pick up his phone and, now awake, note down his nocturnal musings as they came to him – erratically, passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
        The question he was trying to settle was the nature of the paradox of parental love. Did one more perfectly communicate the nature of parental love by approaching it as an exercise in equipping one’s offspring with everything they would need to go out into the world and fend for themselves? Or did one instead demonstrate one’s knowledge of what love really is by clasping the child tight to oneself, hanging one’s entire happiness on its whims, saying <em>you are me, what I am is what you let me do for you, all you will let me do for you.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        How – for this is what it came down to – did one teach love?
    </p>
    <p>
        Like all paradoxes, the answer was that it was both. Parents were perforce Hegelians, except for the occasions when the sheer corporeality of the relation – the soiled nappies; the facial bruising – turned them into materialists.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gabor’s wife, Juliana, had told him that she was not satisfied with his childcare; apparently he cared for their daughter like an intellectual. This was doubtless true. But I suspect Juliana’s gripe was with something else, as his intellect was certainly one of the reasons she fell in love with him in the first place. That being said, it was true: Gabor put almost as much effort and energy into critiquing the nature and historical genealogy of unpaid care work as he did into executing it. Was this what bothered Juliana? Surely it could only have concerned her <em>that</em> he do his fair share of care work. Whether he did it mindlessly or critically ought to have been irrelevant to her.
    </p>
    <p>
        Intellectual or not, their shared parental leave had its carnal highlights. It was as if the corporeality of all of these new tasks alerted them the more soberly to the needs of their bodies. And, later on, as Elena began gaining motor skills, and to be within the radius of her erratic little arms became downright hazardous, the consent and maturity of physical contact with Juliana began to take on a new attraction. If Gabor wanted Juliana to hit him in the face, he was going to have to ask her to do so. He felt like he had arrived at the most axiomatic of erotics.
    </p>
    <p>
        But there were also straightforward moments of elixir. One day they went walking in a cemetery – an urban antispace they had only come to appreciate since becoming parents. Elena fell asleep in the sling on his chest and Juliana sucked him off behind a hawthorn bush. As he  helplessly approached his climax, he thought of those men who are so obese they hadn’t seen their sex for decades – even its tip at erection. And then, more fittingly I suppose, pregnant women who, for a number of months, are denied line-of-sight contact with their pubes. For indeed, what would one’s relation with one’s own arse be like if one didn’t need to squat over an iPhone on selfie mode to see it? These technologies are not so old, but we can barely remember what we were like before the last update, let alone before the internet. Had Gabor been lonely as a child for want of the interconnectivity of the internet, or would he have been lonelier still in its embrace?
    </p>
    <p>
        The invisibility of his ejaculate in that cemetery, when it burst out, made him feel that this orgasm was in a profound way more feminine than any he had previously experienced, an orgasm that had happened inside him.
    </p>
    <p>
        The sling that bound Elena to his breast in that cemetery provided other boundary-blurring moments, too. One night, when Elena had already thrice refused to be laid down in her cot and Gabor’s patience was waning, he ventured from their internet-free bedroom to the kitchen, where the oven extractor’s dim LED-glow made practically somnambulent darts for bottle-refills possible, and he went browsed some social media for a while. Tiring of it, he leaned against the kitchen surface and glanced down at Elena. In the soft metallic light, her features seemed like those of a young adult. The sight arrested Gabor. Suspended in the sling like this, Gabor realised, Elena’s nigh-on one-year-old head rested at a height not dissimilar to that at which his wife’s own head was, of its body’s own accord, supported. His wife’s head had frequently been in exactly the same position as Elena’s was now, cleaved to his breast, askance, raised slightly so as to look up into his eves. Conscious that it was the same gesture as he had made many a time with his wife, Gabor bent his head down to sniff at Elena’s hair. He imagined her waking up, looking up at him and asking him whether he wanted to watch something on Netflix. All of a sudden he was confused, and his feelings tripped over themselves in their erotics. His sex stirred, and he considered masturbating there in the kitchen, but he was unsure whether he would be able to remain with the image of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        Gabor became a father because a friend of his ordered a coffee in a particular tone of voice, and he looked up from his phone and didn’t scroll down to a particular article about the vicissitudes of parenthood and thus never read the article; he became a father because he spoke to someone at a party about a novel and she told him her son loved the novel; he became a father because the supermarket had just started running a range of permaculture products and that afternoon it had seemed like the world might be moving in the right direction after all. He became a father because of Juliane; falling in love with her had been a journey to the end of her body, and I think we might even say that Gabor had already known back then, when she was offering her body up to him so completely, that he was going to want to see everything that it could do.
    </p>
    <p>
    If a man is lucky, he sires a child as a result of love. But the two things – love and what the Germans call <em>Fortpflanzung</em> (literally, “planting yourself forth”) – could not be more different. We do not fall in love because of the coincidences; the coincidences occur because we are falling in love. Birth, on the other hand, is the mother of all coincidence, and therefore the ultimate expression of telos.
    </p>
    <p>
        We cannot ask, of the decision to have a child, whether it was the right decision – a concept laughably quaint in its anxiety – since the experience so utterly reconstitutes our subjecthood that we are no longer the same person to ask this question of the past. The “I” who chose to have a child – if indeed one did choose to do so – is gone. In its stead there is just the child and your existence around her.
    </p>
    <p>
        Am I trying to suggest that Gabor would have regretted parenthood if it hadn’t reforged his identity so utterly? I am trying to suggest that such questions can help us only as much as we look at ourselves in the moment of their asking, not of their being answered.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Elena’s second year, Gabor began frequenting the playground with her. This was not only a process of socialisation for Elena; Gabor too felt like a debutante in a completely new realm of society. The forms and customs of interactions with other parents indicated fundamentally new figures of sameness and otherness as had hitherto governed his social encounters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Extrapolating from his experience, Gabor concluded that, for fathers, the second year of a child’s like is as foundational as the first year is for mothers. A newborn is – let us not mince our words – a blob. Avowedly, if you have carried this blob in you for nine months, you will be wont to see things differently. But if you have not, it is axiomatic that you can scarcely be expected to have the same feelings of love for it. The love of a non-birthing parent is thus the zenith of immateriality. I cannot overstate the importance of this revelation for understanding Gabor’s development. And why else, after all, are you and I here?
    </p>
    <p>
        By the end of Elena’s second year, Gabor felt a love for her so all-consuming and so novel to him that he wondered how he had made sense of the world prior to it. The answer, though it took many years to come to him, was obvious: neither before Elena’s arrival nor after it was there any sense to be discovered in anyone. And in fact he wasn’t really asking the question in order to find the answer, but rather simply to indulge in the revelation itself. Nihilism had been a talisman of his adult life; even in the throes of this all-consuming love Gabor could probably, if he’d tried hard enough, work his way down to the incontrovertible fact of meaningless.
    </p>
    <p>
        But perhaps, we might object, simply in his decision to ask this question rhetorically, to become playful in his relationship with the lack of sense in the universe, Gabor had in fact begun to apprehend the greater, magical sense that science cannot grasp? Perhaps. But I suspect the more compelling option is simply to liberate love from the burden of being the single source of light in our benighted world. Love doesn’t manumit us. Love is just love.
    </p>
    <p>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        Yet a curious thing had also happened in this second year of Elena’s life: Gabor discovered that the world was full of other children. This may sounds trivial to us, but for Gabor it was a revelation. Elena was his ticket into a secret world hiding in plain sight. Access to playgrounds, access to a nursery, access to friends’ flats where other toddlers toddled around. Gradually, and thanks to Elena, Gabor was resocialised into a community filled with children. And every single one of them was a world to be discovered. Every time Gabor met a child, he burned with curiosity to get to know them, to learn a little about their personality. To talk to them, or, if they were not yet languaged, to observe them and see how they tackled the situations life thrust upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before Elena had even been born the thought had occurred to Gabor that he was probably, at some stage or other, going to have the thought of wondering what it would be like to have sex with her. Every father, even if just once – though it never is – imagines having sex with his daughter. In fact, he imagines having sex with his son, too. Gabor suspected that mothers imagine the same. But no one spoke about it. And whilst he allowed himself generalisations about his own penised kind on this matter, that seemed a step too far.
    </p>
    <p>
        Trivially, to think something and to do that thing are worlds apart, and Gabor decided to accept that he would occasionally think this thought and resolved not to let himself get too worked up about it.
    </p>
    <p>
        By the age of four Elena had reached such a degree of beauty that Gabor frequently struggled to focus on what she was saying because he became so distracted staring at her cheeks, her eyebrows, her mouth or her eyes. The sheer perfection was crippling. May I emphasise that it is beauty we are talking about here and not attraction? That is a crucial difference. Attraction is what Gabor felt for his wife, in whom he continued to revel, the thrill of having created a human together  - and entirely on their own! - continuing to nourish their nocturnal caprices.
    </p>
    <p>
        This was perhaps the main difference between his own daughter and all other children. In principle, he found all other children as interesting as his own. But none of them came close in terms of beauty. Indeed, I have often wondered whether we shouldn’t accord aesthetics a greater significance when making sense of our lives. After all, even fools judge by appearances; they just judge badly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Incidentally, you will perhaps be acquainted with other works of mine, in which I muse on Nietzsche’s theory of eternal return. Having a child somewhat altered my thinking on this matter, but not in the way you might think. <em>Reproduction</em> is in fact nothing of the sort. Nothing is reproduced when a baby emerges, not even a species. ‘Life itself’, I suppose, but that’s nothing but an Attenboroughian platitude. No, the idea of reproduction is pure kitsch, and it must be resisted if truth is to be of any value.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gabor had never recognised himself in his daughter, nor his wife. Elena was Elena and nothing else. He felt very little urge to ‘pass on’ to her any contingent preferences that he happened to have. He stole glances at her, as she played astronaut, and pitied Nietzsche his poverty of insight.
    </p>
    <p>
        Elena began to voice her dissatisfaction that Gabor would show such interest in other children. At the playground, he would play with her, and as other children came by and joined in, he would strike up conversation with them, and Elena would grow quiet or wander off, only to reproach him later at home. At nursery, whilst picking her up, Gabor would greet other children by name, and they would start performing tricks for him or telling him, urgently, what they had done that day. Who was he to spurn these quick and hungry humans, to shrug them off by insinuating he only had eyes for his own offspring?
    </p>
    <p>
        His convictions hardened. Why should he feel more for a child to whom he was bound by a single orgasm than any other? If he could develop unconditional, asphyxiating love for a child he had not carried and had not birthed, then could he not do it for any other one? <em>Should</em> he not do it for every other one? Gabor felt a private thread of solidarity, of love even, extend from deep inside him to every child in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was not dissimilar, Gabor was perfectly aware, to what he had felt about women in a previous chapter of his life. In his twenties there had been precious few limits on the kinds of women to whom he was attracted. Large, old, nerdy, sour, sporty, punky, professionally ambitious, working class. He had wanted to know them all. He had wanted to sleep with them all. In fact, the only group he had shied away from as a group were the women who were, or aspired to be, conventionally attractive. These women disappeared, right in front of him. They were commoditised according to the dictates of men with power and money, and in fact they exuded not womanliness but manliness. Would Lucian Freud have painted these women? Precisely.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was obvious to Gabor why he found children so arrestingly fascinating. They were everything adults were not. They were free. They were curious. Indeed there were a few adults who still lived such lives, and indeed he found their presence similar, though not quite equal, to that of children. And, I hasten to add, there were of course children who, at five, had apparently given up on the world; children who were dead on the inside, stuffed full of <em~>Warenförmigkeit</em~>, their fantasy shriveled to a dry cracking husk. These children he steered clear of. He was well aware that he was not on a mission to save certain children, whatever that might mean. He simply wanted to enjoy the intoxicating company of those humans who lived life to the full.
    </p>
    <p>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        Gabor once asked me why, in my opinion, so few men wrote literature about housework. And yet as I write these lines, committing this memory to paper for the first time, I am suddenly unsure whether it was Gabor at all, and not just some stranger I mistook for him as a result of my writing.
    </p>
    <p>
        And in fact of course it was a stranger; it was a young man in Berlin, whom I encountered in the kitchen of a flat where an orgy was going on. The more we write, the more strangers come eerily to resemble our characters. Over a bowl of muesli the man at the orgy told me about a short story he was working on called <em>Die Leiden des mittelaltrigen Werthers</em>, and now I suppose, were we to meet again, orgy or not he would no doubt perceive me as resembling a character of his.
    </p>
    <p>
        Serving Elena took its toll on Gabor’s body. He had become a father at an age increasingly considered usual for reproduction, but let us not be in two minds about it: he had been approaching the end of his youth. Not that he knew it! This, in fact, is my definition of the concept of youth: we can truly comprehend the concept of youth only when we are no longer young. Negative self-epistemics, I call it. By my definition Gabor was still young when Juliana had Elena, for the simple reason that he had not yet realised that he was no longer young.
    </p>
    <p>
        That realisation was to come within a matter of days, however.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whilst still in what the Germans call the <em>Wochenbett</em>, holed up in their flat and yet to receive their first visitor but for the midwife, Gabor discovered his first white pubic hair whilst lying in the bathtub during an idle moment. Shocked, he commenced a thorough examination of his body.
    </p>
    <p>
        Further isolated follicles were identified in the following months. Mortality is mortality, but since hair is already dead matter, we find ourselves distinguishing between decline as manifest in the transformation of our hirsute outer shells and that of our more fleshy corporeality.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first signs of this genuine decay appeared in Elena’s fifth year. One day, whilst doing yoga, Gabor glanced down at his knee to see a spread of wrinkles in the crease of his calf next to his knee. Within a matter of months, simply folding his arms would release sufficient tension from the skin to wrinkle the entire forearm. Gabor was shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
        Privately he blamed Elena, stealing his beauty and youth, sapping it from him slowly but surely. Yet she had taken it and increased it a hundredfold. Who could begrudge her that?
    </p>
    <p>
        He agonised for weeks, too humiliated to speak to his wife about it. Too troubled even to joke about it. And then, with a smile, it came to him. This obsession with the changes in his body: he had known this once before. As an adolescent he had pored over his body, watching it change. He still remembered the very first pube that had sprouted, curling so soon as if it were having second thoughts, rounding on itself. The plague of acne that descended on his face, which he soon discovered was so satisfyingly painful to pop.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bodily time, which had ground to a halt at the end of adolescence, was starting to move forward again. His body was a living being once more. And that was exciting to witness and reflect on.
    </p>
    <p>
        What was this phase of life to which he was transitioning, and was it, analogue to that time before, a moment of awakening? Or was it one of disappearance? And if so, could it perhaps be beneficial to disappear? Or be rendered in some way <em>less</em>, rather than more?
    </p>
    <p>
        In these cogitations he was assisted by Elena’s indefatigable maturation. Her burgeoning beauty seemed the physical manifestation for all the ways in which she was extracting life, wisdom and skill from him. At almost every waking moment of his day he reveled in this process. And yet a tiny part of him was realising that once this process was complete, he truly would be destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
        One day, the solution presented itself with quiet alacrity. He would adopt a younger child. Elena would be awfully jealous, but it would do her good, he decided. He wasn’t sure whether he could adopt a child without Juliana’s agreement – they were married after all. But he could always divorce her. They would continue to see each other and make love, he was sure of that. But surely she wouldn’t deny him this pleasure? And there were so many children needing a new home! He could not imagine abandoning one’s own child, but then again if no one did so, there would be no children for him to adopt! How mysterious life was.
    </p>
    <p>
        Elena was ten now and for a while he had been enjoying her company less and less. He was losing her to the world, and if he was not to become resentful about this fact, he was going to need to do something to address the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gabor told Elena about his plans on the way back from a performance at the children’s theatre. He told her he was already in discussions with an adoption agency, which was a lie, but he wanted to see Elena’s full reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Jesus, dad, you’re so weird. Why don’t you just go and work in a nursery?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “A nursery? But I don’t want to do it for <em>money</em>. I want to care for someone, nuture them.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Educators in nurseries don’t get paid very much, I don’t think they do it for money, either They do it because they love children. Do you love children? Or do you just love being in control?”
    </p>
    <p>
        “There are plenty of adults I could be in control of, if I wanted to be.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “I’m not sure that’s a particularly good answer, dad.” Elena locked her screen and slid her phone into her pocket. “You don’t get to own us, you know. And you don’t get to use us to make up for stuff.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Gabor smiled benevolently at Elena’s naive understanding of what parenthood was. How could we not use parenthood to make up for stuff, he wanted to ask her, but of course it was such ignorance that had for a long time made Elena’s companionship so blissful.
    </p>
    <p>
        Or did she understand more than he thought? Did she understand more than he did?
    </p>
    <p>
        He went back to the drawing board, wondering whether it would break Elena’s heart if he adopted another child. She was no longer young enough to simply throw a tantrum at something that displeased her, and her methods of communication were subtle and myriad.
    </p>
    <p>
        Should he do what she needed or what he needed?
    </p>
    <p>
        He went back to his mobile phone thoughts from those first grueling months of Elena’s life. He had still not answered the deepest question. Which one is the positive? The parent or the child? Which is the one from whom everything proceeds? Was vicariousness the purest form of egoism? Or was it its salvation?
    </p>
    <p>
        Gabor took the sling down from the shelf inside the wardrobe and made a note on his phone to see what he could get for it on eBay.
