        The Babysitter - John Donne*
    </h1>
    <p style="font-family:avenir;">
           
        In twelve weeks' time, the surgeon says, begloved,</br>
               A test will indicate the severance</br>
               Of sex from seed,</br>
               And ne'er again before our love</br>
               Will we need deference.</br>
               To celebrate my infertility</br>
               The babysitter I shall book, but we</br>
               Will be the ones to stay and fool around,</br>
               Whilst they freeze with the kids at the playground.</br>
</br>

               But not just once I'll have her take them out</br>
               And occupy them whilst I feast on you;</br>
               No - every week</br>
               I want our darlings out the flat</br>
               So we can want and do.</br>
               Yea, even when you want it most: we can!</br>
               A simple cut, can that unholy be?</br>
               And we, who procreated to a plan,</br>
               To fornicate once more are queerly free</br>
</br>
               I ne'er had known such love like this mad grind</br>
               Betwixt the Playmobil strewn on the floor;</br>
               It is their feat</br>
               To calm our o'erly restless minds</br>
               And have us touch the more.</br>
               So here I lie, my sex upon a knife,</br>
               Despite misgivings on your part. O heart:</br>
               Two times did its eruption lead to life;</br>
               But what if us a third would drive apart?
