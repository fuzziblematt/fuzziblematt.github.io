        The Babysitter - John Donne*
    </h1>
    <p style="font-family:avenir;"><pre>
           
               In twelve weeks' time, the surgeon says, begloved,
               A test will indicate the severance
               Of sex from seed,
               And ne'er again before our love
               Will we need deference.
               To celebrate my infertility
               The babysitter I shall book, but we
               Will be the ones to stay and fool around,
               Whilst they freeze with the kids at the playground.

               But not just once I'll have her take them out
               And occupy them whilst I feast on you;
               No - every week
               I want our darlings out the flat
               So we can want and do.
               Yea, even when you want it most: we can!
               A simple cut, can that unholy be?
               And we, who procreated to a plan,
               To fornicate once more are queerly free

               I ne'er had known such love like this mad grind
               Betwixt the Playmobil strewn on the floor;
               It is their feat
               To calm our o'erly restless minds
               And have us touch the more.
               So here I lie, my sex upon a knife,
               Despite misgivings on your part. O heart:
               Two times did its eruption lead to life;
               But what if us a third would drive apart?
