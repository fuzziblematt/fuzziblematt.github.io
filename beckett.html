    <h1>Milly, Molly and Junior - Samuel Beckett*</h1>

    <p>
    Milly and Molly won’t get off the swings now. That farce of a thing some call daylight is long since gone, and I have just remarked that we must start thinking about making our way home for tea. With the regularity of a pair of kidneys punishing a urethra, they have managed as ever to find themselves on their most cherished diversion at the playground at the precise moment when I must rend them from it.    </p>
    <p>
Oh they don’t swing. No one swings on these swings. No one can. I shall explain forthwith. It is at most a spinning. An orbiting, I should say. Closer they come, to each other, further they go away again. It’s not their fault; the swings are a piece of shit.    </p>
    <p>
For reasons that elude someone of my education, carpenters or whoever it is designs playground equipment these days embrace wood’s natural contours when constructing their rides, spurning the practicability of trunks lathed to cylindrical perfection. Perhaps they feel that this is the only way children can apprehend their own colossal mortality, by perceiving the natural in the things with which we surround them. Perhaps it is scientifically proven that children engage with each other better when in environments devoid of straight lines. It matters little. The upshot of this flourish in ecological urban planning is that the chains suspending the seats hang at heights that differ by a matter of inches. Now of course this particular carpenter was no fool and made sure to compensate for this delicious contingency of vegetal life by shortening the requisite chain by the requisite amount. All well and good, you may think, but for a little asymmetry. Now I would be the last person to take offence at a bit of asymmetry; what little symmetry I myself ever had was soon warped beyond all recovery during the months that followed my emergence from a hospital some hours after Junior’s own emergence into it. Crowning through the sliding doors as we headed for the pre-booked taxi, MaxiCosi in my left arm, my body perhaps suspected even then, in that quiet way that bodies do and don’t, that it had just passed its taught, geometric apogee. But now operate these swings in the manner in which they were intended, as occasionally happens, or would happen, for a minute and a half or two minutes at most, both of the swings I mean, and the necessary outcome of their skewed rocking is a collision of surprisingly unappealing nature to children. And so Milly and Molly content themselves with their donutting, dragging their feet idly in the sand and processing, so I am told, everything that happened to them at nursery today.    </p>
    <p>
Junior absconded the moment I mentioned going home. Always does. Home James! Dinner o’clock! Food-ee food-ee grub grub! I try them all each time – the appeals to their bowels and their sense of social convention. Must be something about home. Revulsion. I wouldn’t disagree. Different reasons, perhaps. But only perhaps. The tea will certainly cold by the time we get there. The meat for the kids. Room temperature, or worse. The protein chains are doubtless all still intact, or whatever protein is. All the same, there is value in the institution of a warm tea. Junior is now perched atop the roof of the toddlers’ tower. He’s screaming expletives, but not at me. At the universe, unbearable as it evidently is to him. Enviable the joy of swear words not yet worn out. Although I’ll grant him he has rejuvenated some of the fouler peripheries of my own tongue. Small consolation. Yet was ever a consolation big? They’ll be at me soon, his curses, once I become earnest. Any more careless than he’s currently being and he’ll tumble from that tower and muggins here will be carting him off to A&E. Well, and who will get to eat his meat, then? Hope springs. Do I drag him first or the twins? Them I can secure in the buggy, but there’s something to be said for working myself up to them on him first. I’m no match for the three of them at once.    </p>
    <p>
Twins! At my age! At her age! Then again, twins at any age. And now with language. The three of them. And each with different arguments, different objections, different rhetorical nuances. Laying siege to me until I capitulate and pour agave syrup down their throats whilst sellotaping their heads to devices streaming Peppa Pig. A hole in the screen for a funnel; if I owned a drill bit of sufficient diameter, I warrant I’d have tried it by now. Then they would truly be in sweet, porcine paradise. You’re big but I’m growing! One more because I didn’t have so many special treats today and tomorrow is already weekend! Let’s just not tell mum, there’s loads of things you don’t tell mum, daddy! Three arguments from three directions and there was only one gummi bear left in any case. How will any of us have the strength to manage the stairs?     </p>
    <p>
        Cashew loaf for me tonight.
    </p>
    <p>
Milly tells me she won’t give Molly a nosebleed if I let them stay five minutes longer. You give me something I give you something. You give me more playground I give you not hit Molly on the nose. The abyss before me. I am on the point of assembling a reply that takes account of Milly’s desire to visit violence upon someone dear to her whilst also appealing to her longer-term self-interest, when a gnarled stick propelled by Junior nearly ruptures some of my most highly sensitive tissue. A rupture from without, that would have been a change.    </p>
    <p>
        We must get home.
    </p>
    <p>
There is a hole in Junior’s warm trousers and the new, larger pair is yet to arrive in the post. The other father and I had exchanged messages on eBay to clarify minor yet pertinent aspects of the item. Did those stick-on name tapes you pay a fortune for actually adhere to the material? Was the patch covering the left knee iron-on or sown on, and in the case of the latter, had it been done by a professional or by the father himself? Was the packaging he intended to use to send the trousers zero-waste? That is what I value most about grass-roots alternative marketplaces, the space generated for the human interaction. But now Junior’s new togs have still not arrived and the seam of his current pair has come apart to the point where he has noticed that he can save the bother of removing his trousers when he needs to pee. What he does with his Big Boy Pants heaven only knows.    </p>
    <p>
It is not possible to remember that fraction of my life before the arrival of Junior, and I’m glad of it. It wasn’t an edifying series of events. If my hand wasn’t shoved down my gullet it was clasping my cock. Thanks to catastrophic parenting I’m broadly ambidextrous and it’s a wonder it never occurred to me to attempt both at the same time. At times I earned money, at times I spent it, and when I was doing neither I was on occasion not unhappy. No, there is little to revisit.    </p>
    <p>
In fact I would venture to say that Junior’s advent in this family was as great a turning point in my life as if I’d squeezed him out of any one of my orifices myself. Indeed for a brief period it seemed as if medical technology was advancing at such a gallop that it might have been possible for me to do the gestating the second time around. The genesis of life is and remains something by which I am profoundly humbled.    </p>
    <p>
        No, what I regret was giving the three of them language.
    </p>
    <p>
How I yearn for those long dark mornings in midwinter when Junior would wake at four, fresh and alert like the concept of democracy in pre-Socratic Athens, and my partner would press him to my bosom and neither of us would say a thing and I would remove myself to the living room for the early shift. Hour upon hour of speechless play. The communion. The companionship. I had not thought to experience such companionship again.    </p>
    <p>
Much to my surprise I found myself wanting to speak – a truly shocking predicament. My tongue, that reluctant, recalcitrant hunk of meat that normally roused itself simply to let vomit emerge and replace it, as replace it it must, with fresh fodder, suddenly jumped to life, coaxed to movement by the knowledge that it would not be engaging in battle with an adversary but simply dancing alone like a candle someone was neglecting to extinguish. To speak into the silence. I filled those early hours with monologues on all aspects of life as I had humbly thus far known it. How to mend shoes with garden twine; how to prize ingrowing bodyhairs from their ostrich follicles; where the greatest pelican crossings in the city were to be found. I declaimed a world, whilst Junior patiently assembled his uniqueness with the assistance of an IKEA conical pyramid.    </p>
    <p>
I should have seen it coming when the babbling began. But instead I fell deeper in love with this creature, I’m not too proud to say so. I thrilled at the richness of the noises – the certitude with which they were on some occasions flung at the world; the idle felicity with which they would barely venture forth from Junior’s mouth on others. The unparalleled superiority of intention bereft language.     </p>
    <p>
The issuing of the first actual words came as something of a shock. “Nestlé!”. “Adidas!”. Well, not quite, but not far off. It was clear where we were going. Already the world was at him, like a virus multiplying in his throat. The final straw was when two-word sentences emerged, the mystifying, entrancing gargles now retreating from his world as swiftly as the glaciers are from ours, and it was only then that I began to understand what monstrosity was to emerge. Where had that nonsensical music gone? Why could it not stay?    </p>
    <p>
The orders grew more sophisticated and the inability to feign incomprehension lashed me to the execution of his orders. More cheese! Cocklate now! Mayonnaise on the ketchup! I attempted to engage with him but it only made it worse. For Junior attended to my parries, to my rejoinders, he imbibed them thirstily, only to hurl them back at me within hours as the next skirmish flared. Your own fault! Don’t talk to me like that! I didn’t ask to be brought into this vale of tears! A couple of months earlier it would take a week for him to pick up a new word, now he was spitting rhetorical techniques back at me within one episode of Paw Patrol. He had ridden bare-back atop my language and left me with nothing to call my own.     </p>
    <p>
    And then the twins arrived and within the blink of an eye they were at it too. With Junior around, Milly and Molly’s grace period of private language was reduced mercilessly. He excelled at teaching them, and unlike I he understood that was what he was doing. He intuited far further into their babbles than I had ever done or wanted to do. He would reach in and hand them words with which they would equip themselves for combat with me a matter of months down the line. Even my daily voice-memo recordings of them are tainted with his languaged intercessions. When I have time I shall edit them out. </p>
    <p>
The only relief to be hoped for is that one day, not far away now I suspect, I will reach that state of decrepitude that renders me little more than a fat, wrinkled version of their own initially helpless selves. I shall be the one needing nappies changed; I shall need to be spoon-fed and grant someone else the oversight of my finances. Ah, vengeance for them! And language? Gone! True, it will be my decomposing heap of flesh from which the silence will issue, not their miniature cherubic forms. But it will be silence all the same. Language silenced is the same exquisite thing regardless of which bodies stop it in its tracks, which tongues are lamed. Yes, no doubt they will hurl diatribes at me, just like I did to them. Getting their own back, telling it all as they saw it. Their differing opinions on the pelican crossing league table, say. And no doubt I will issue inchoate noises on my way out of language just as did they on their way into it. Will they cherish them the way I will always do theirs? The way I cherish them even as I collapse under the unceasing language, the unceasing talk, the unceasing negotiating from the moment the breakfast boxes are packed before nursery in the morning to the moment the jammies are forced over their refusing limbs in the evening?    </p>
    <p>
Perhaps there shall even be some moments when the monologues abate, when they tend to their own chores of reproduction, and I am left alone, when I shall be at liberty to listen to the voice memos on repeat. I look forward to that. The very idea of it steels me as I prepare now for another clash with the three of them and their terrifying faith in language. We must make it back for food; we must make it back for water. And no one here, despite occasional – but only occasional – gesturing to the contrary, will lift a finger to make it happen save me.    </p>
