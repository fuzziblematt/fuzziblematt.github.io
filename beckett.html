    <h1>Milly, Molly and Junior - Samuel Beckett*</h1>

    <p>
    Milly and Molly won’t get off the swings now. That farce of a thing some call daylight is long since gone, and I have just suggested for the first time that we should start thinking about making our way home. With the reliable regularity of a pair of kidneys punishing a urethra, they have absconded to the same corner of the playground as always when I draw their attention to the in their eyes no doubt regrettable though barely comprehensible finitude of time.
    </p>
    <p>
    Oh they don’t swing. No one swings on these swings. No one can. I shall explain forthwith. It is at most a spinning. An orbiting, I should say. Closer they come, to each other, further they go away again. It’s not their fault; the swings are a piece of shit.
    </p>
    <p>
    For reasons that elude someone of my education, the carpenter or whoever it is designs playground equipment decided to make a feature of the wood’s natural contours in the swings’ construction. He, or she, or they – who am I to say – elected not to lathe the trunks to cylindrical perfection. Perhaps they felt that this was the only way the children could apprehend their own colossal mortality, by perceiving the natural in the things with which we surround them. Perhaps it is scientifically proven that children engage with each other better when in environments devoid of straight lines. It matters little. The upshot of this flourish in ecological urban planning is that the chains suspending the seats hang at heights that differ by a few inches. Now of course the carpenter was no fool and made sure to compensate for this delicious contingency of vegetal life by shortening the requisite chain by the requisite amount. All well and good, you may think, but for a little asymmetry. Now I would be the last person to take offence to a bit of asymmetry; what little symmetry I myself ever had was soon warped beyond all recovery during the days and nights that followed my emergence from a hospital with someone who had not strictly speaking entered it. Or had not strictly speaking been a one when he did so. But now operate these swings in the manner in which they were intended, as occasionally happens, or would happen, for a minute and a half or two minutes at most, both of the swings I mean, and the necessary outcome of their skewed rocking is a collision of surprisingly unappealing nature to children. And so Milly and Molly content themselves with their donutting, dragging their feet idly in the sand and processing, so I am told, everything that happened to them at nursery today.

        Junior disappeared the moment I mentioned going home. Always does. Home James! Dinner o’clock! Food-ee food-ee grub grub! I try them all each time – the appeals to their bowels and their sense of social convention. Must be something about home. Revulsion. I wouldn’t disagree. Different reasons, perhaps. But only perhaps. The tea is certainly cold by now. The meat for the kids. All room temperature. The protein chains are doubtless all still ok, or whatever protein is. But still. Junior is now perched atop the roof of the toddlers’ tower. He’s screaming expletives, but not at me. At the universe, unbearable as it evidently is to him. Enviable the joy of swear words not yet worn out. Although I’ll grant him he rejuvenated my use of some foul corners of my own tongue. Small consolation. Yet was ever a consolation big? They’ll be at me soon, his curses, once I become earnest. If he falls off of that tower and is hauled off to A&E, who will get to eat his meat, then? Hope springs. Do I drag him first or the twins? Them I can clip in the buggy, but there’s something to be said for working myself up to them on him first. I’m no match for the three of them at once.
    </p>
    <p>
        Twins. At my age. At her age. Then again, twins at any age. And now with language. The three of them. And each with different arguments, different objections, different rhetorical nuances. Laying siege to me until I capitulate and pour agave syrup down their throats whilst sellotaping their heads to devices streaming Peppa Pig. A hole in the screen for a funnel, they’re yet to think of that. Then they would truly be in sweet, porcine paradise. You’re big but I’m growing. One more because I didn’t have so many special treats today and tomorrow is already weekend. Let’s just not tell mum, there’s loads of things you don’t tell mum, daddy. Three arguments from three directions and there was only one gummi bear left in any case. How will any of us have the strength to manage the stairs? Cashew loaf for me tonight.
    </p>
    <p>
        Milly tells me she won’t give Molly a nosebleed if I let them stay five minutes longer. You give me something I give you something. You give me more playground I give you not hit Molly on the nose. The abyss before me. I am on the point of assembling a reply that takes account of Milly’s desire to visit violence upon someone dear to her whilst also appealing to her longer-term self-interest, when a gnarled stick propelled by Junior nearly ruptures some of my most highly sensitive tissue. A rupture from without, that would have been a change.
    </p>
    <p>
        We must get home.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a hole in Junior’s warm trousers and the new, larger pair is yet to arrive in the post from a father with whom I exchanged no fewer than thirty messages on eBay simply to learn the dimensions of the trousers, their actual colour in natural light (I mean a Pantone code would have done the job) rather than the screen of any of my four devices with evening mode on or off, and whether the material was such that those stick-on name tapes you pay a fortune for would live up to their washable claim. And now they were still not there and the fraying of the seam has worsened to the point where Junior has noticed that he can save the bother of removing his trousers when nature calls. What he does with his Big Boy Pants heaven only knows.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is not possible to remember that fraction of my life before the arrival of Junior, and I’m glad of it. It wasn’t an edifying series of events. If my hand wasn’t shoved down my gullet it was clasping my cock. Thanks to catastrophic parenting I’m broadly ambidextrous and it’s a wonder it never occurred to me to attempt both at the same time. At times I earned money, at times I spent it, and when I was doing neither I was on occasion not unhappy. No, there is little to revisit.
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact I would venture to say that Junior’s advent in this family was as great a turning point in my life as if I’d squeezed him out of any one of my orifices myself. A beautiful day it was. And the day the twins wrenched their way out – or in – constituted another remarkable moment of humility on my part in the face of the world and all it’s beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
        No, what I regret was giving the three of them language.
    </p>
    <p>
        How I pine for those long dark mornings in midwinter when Junior would wake at four, fresh and merry like a rewilded meadow in May, and my partner would press him to my bosom and neither of us would say a thing and I would remove myself to the living room for the early shift. Hour upon hour of speechless play. The communion. The companionship. I had not thought to experience such companionship again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Much to my surprise I found myself wanting to speak – a truly shocking predicament. My tongue, that reluctant, recalcitrant piece of meat that normally roused itself simply to let vomit emerge and replace it, as replace it it must, with fresh fodder, suddenly jumped to life, coaxed to movement by the knowledge that it would not be engaging in battle with an adversary but simply dancing alone like a candle someone neglected to extinguish. To speak into the silence. I filled those early hours with monologues on all aspects of life as I had humbly thus far known it. How to mend shoes, how to prize ingrowing bodyhair from their ostrich follicles. Where the greatest pelican crossings in the city were to be found. I declaimed a world, whilst Junior patiently explored his uniqueness with an IKEA conical pyramid.
    </p>
    <p>
        I should have seen it coming when the babbling began. But instead I fell deeper in love with this creature, I’m not too proud to say so. Suspecting nothing I marveled as the first actual words formed. “Nestle”. “Adidas”. Well, not quite, but not far off. It was clear where we were going. Already the world was at him, like a virus multiplying in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was when he began ordering me around that I began to understand what monstrosity was to emerge. More cheese! Cocklate now! Mayonnaise on the ketchup! I attempted to engage with him but it only made it worse. For Junior attended to my parries, to my rejoinders, he imbibed them thirstily, only to hurl them back at me within hours as the next skirmish flared. Your own fault! Don’t talk to me like that! I didn’t ask to be flung into this paroxystic vale of tears! A couple of months ago it would take a week for him to pick up a new word, now he was spitting rhetorical techniques back at me within two episodes of Paw Patrol. He had ridden bare-back on top of my language and left me with nothing of my own.
    </p>
    <p>
        And then the twins arrived and within the blink of an eye there were at it too. And they had a contemporary to learn from, he taught them his greatest tricks, I know it for sure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some days I sit there darning socks whilst they’re at nursery, hatching plans to bring them to silence. I wonder what I would need to say to shut them up. For a whole afternoon. What series of mind-boggling turns of phrase it would take.
    </p>
    <p>
        The only relief to be hoped for is that one day, not far away now I suspect, I will reach that state of decrepitude that renders me little more than a fat, wrinkled version of their own initially helpless selves. I shall be the one needing nappies changed; I shall need to be spoon-fed and grant someone else the oversight of my finances. Ah, vengeance! And language? Gone! It will be my rotting carcass from which the silence will issue forth, not their miniature cherubic forms. But it will be silence all the same. Language silenced is the same exquisite thing regardless of which bodies stop it in its tracks – which tongues sit lame in their holsters. Yes, no doubt they will hurl diatribes at me, just like I did to them. Getting their own back, telling it all as they saw it. And no doubt I will issue inchoate noises on my way out of language as did they on their way into it. We can’t have it all. But it will be myriad times better than actual talk, actual arguing, actual non-stop negotiating from the moment the breakfast boxes are packed before nursery in the morning to the moment the jammies are forced over their limbs in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
        Perhaps there shall even be some moments when the monologues cease – when they tend to their own chores of reproduction, and I am left in true peace, when I shall dedicate my forces to thinking. I look forward to that. The very image of it steels me as I prepare now for another clash with the three of them and their terrifying faith in language. We must make it back for food; we must make it back for water. And no one here, despite occasional – but only occasional – gesturing to the contrary, will lift a finger to make it happen, save me.
